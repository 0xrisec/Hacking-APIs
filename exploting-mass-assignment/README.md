# Exploting Mass Assignment

An API is vulnerable to mass assignment if the consumer is able to send a request that updates or overwrites server-side variables. If an API accepts client input without filtering or sanitizing it, an attacker can update objects with which they shouldnâ€™t be able to interact.&#x20;

For example, a banking API might allow users to update the email address associated with their account, but a mass assignment vulnerability might let the user send a request that updates their account balance as well.
