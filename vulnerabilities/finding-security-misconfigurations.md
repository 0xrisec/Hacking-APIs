# Finding Security Misconfigurations

Security misconfigurations represent a large variety of items. At this stage of your testing, look for verbose error messaging, poor transit encryption, and other problematic configurations. Each of these issues can be useful later for exploiting the API.

## Verbose Errors

Error messages exist to help the developers on both the provider and consumer sides understand what has gone wrong.

## Poor Transit Encryption

http does not excrypt network calls.

## Problematic Configurations

I have come across many APIs that had debugging enabled. You have a better chance of finding this sort of misconfiguration in newly developed APIs and in testing environments. in 404 page you can get important infrmation , an erorr.
