# Fuzzing

## Effective Fuzzing

### Targeted fuzzing

Targeted fuzzing payloads are aimed at provoking a response from specific technologies and types of vulnerabilities.

Targeted fuzzing payloads are more useful once you know the technologies being used. If you‚Äôre sending SQL fuzzing payloads to an API that leverages only NoSQL databases, your testing won‚Äôt be as effective.

Targeted fuzzing payload types might include API object or variable names, cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, directories, file extensions, HTTP request methods, JSON or XML data, SQL or No SQL commands, or commands for particular operating systems.

SecList: [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)\
its big-list-of-naughty-strings.txt wordlist is excellent at causing useful responses.

FuzzDB: [https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb)

Wfuzz: [https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) includes a great list that combines several targeted payloads in their injection directory, called All\_attack.txt.\
\
Additionally, you can always quickly and easily create your own generic fuzzing payload list. In a text file, combine symbols, numbers, and characters to create each payload as line-separated entries, like this:&#x20;

```
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
9999999999999999999999999999999999999999
~'!@#$%^&*()-_+
{}[]|:''; '<>?,./
%00 
0x00 
$ne 
%24ne 
$gt 
%24gt 
|whoami
'' '
OR 1=1-- -
'' ''''''
Êº¢, „Åï, –ñ, —™, —¨, —¶, —®, —Æ
üòÄ üòÉ üòÑ üòÅ üòÜ 
```

Note that instead of 40 instances of A or 9, you could write payloads consisting of hundreds of them. Using a small list like this as a fuzzing payload can cause all sorts of useful and interesting responses from an API.

## Detecting Anomalies

You‚Äôll typically be analyzing hundreds or thousands of responses, not just two or three. Therefore, you need to filter your responses to detect anomalies.

For example, if you send input like `~'!@#$%^&*()-_+` to an endpoint that improperly handles it, you could receive an error.

if you issue 100 API requests and 98 of those result in an HTTP 200 response code with a similar response size, you can consider those requests to be your baseline. Also, examine a few of the baseline responses to get a sense of their content. Once you know that the baseline responses have been properly handled, review the two anomalous responses.

the differences between baseline and anomalous requests will be minuscule. For example, the HTTP response codes might all be identical, but a few requests might result in a response size that is a few bytes larger than the baseline responses. When small differences like this come up, use Burp Suite‚Äôs Comparer to get a side-by-side comparison of the differences within the responses. Right-click the result you‚Äôre interested in and choose Send to Comparer (Response). You can send as many responses as you‚Äôd like to Comparer, but you‚Äôll at least need to send two.

## Fuzzing Wide and Deep

Fuzzing wide is the act of sending an input across all of an API‚Äôs unique requests in an attempt to discover a vulnerability

Fuzzing deep is the act of thoroughly testing an individual request with a variety of inputs, replacing headers, parameters, query strings, endpoint paths, and the body of the request with your payloads.

### Fuzzing Wide with Postman

I recommend using Postman to fuzz wide for vulnerabilities across an API, as the tool‚Äôs Collection Runner makes it easy to run tests against all API requests. If an API includes 150 unique requests across all the endpoints, you can set a variable to a fuzzing payload entry and test it across all 150 requests. This is particularly easy to do when you‚Äôve built a collection or imported API requests into Postman.

For example, you might use this strategy to test whether any of the requests fail to handle various ‚Äúbad‚Äù characters. Send a single payload across the API and check for anomalies

Create a Postman environment in which to save a set of fuzzing variables. This lets you seamlessly use the environmental variables from one collection to the next. Once the fuzzing variables are set, you can save or update the environment.

### Fuzzing Deep with Wfuzz

```
wfuzz -z file,/home/hapihacker/big-list-of-naughty-strings.txt -H "Content-Type: application/
json" -H "x-access-token: [...]" -p 127.0.0.1:8080 --hc 400 -X PUT -d "{
\"user\": \"FUZZ\",
\"pass\": \"FUZZ\",
\"id\": \"FUZZ\",
\"name\": \"FUZZ\",
\"is_admin\": \"FUZZ\",
\"account_balance\": \"FUZZ\"
}" -u http://192.168.195.132:8090/api/user/edit_info
```

### Fuzzing Wide for Improper Assets Management

Improper assets management vulnerabilities arise when an organization exposes APIs that are either retired, in a test environment, or still in development. In any of these cases, there is a good chance the API has fewer protections than its supported production counterparts. Improper assets management might affect only a single endpoint or request, so it‚Äôs often useful to fuzz wide to test if improper assets management exists for any request across an API.

Also, check any sort of changelog or GitHub repository. A changelog that says something along the lines of ‚Äúresolved broken object level authorization vulnerability in v3‚Äù will make finding an endpoint still using v1 or v2 all the sweeter.

The production version of the sample API is v2, so it would be a good idea to test a few keywords, like v1, v3, test, mobile, uat, dev, and old, as well as any interesting paths discovered during analysis or reconnaissance test- ing.

Additionally, some API providers will allow access to administrative functionality by adding /internal/ to the path before or after the versioning, which would look like this: /api/v2/internal/users /api/internal/v2/users

### Testing Request Methods with Wfuzz

```
wfuzz -z list,GET-HEAD-POST-PUT-PATCH-TRACE-OPTIONS-CONNECT- -X FUZZ http://testsite.com/api/
v2/account
```

### Fuzzing ‚ÄúDeeper‚Äù to Bypass Input Sanitization

Tricking the server‚Äôs input sanitization code into processing a payload it should normally restrict. There are a few tricks you could use against restricted fields.

First, try sending something that takes the form of the restricted field (if it‚Äôs an email field, include a valid-looking email), add a null byte, and then add another payload position for fuzzing payloads to be inserted. Here‚Äôs an example:&#x20;

`"user": "a@b.com%00¬ßtest¬ß"`&#x20;

Instead of a null byte, try sending a pipe (|), quotes, spaces, and other escape symbols. Better yet, there are enough possible symbols to send that you could add a second payload position for typical escape characters, like this:

`"user": "a@b.com¬ßescape¬ß¬ßtest¬ß"`

Use a set of potential escape symbols for the `¬ßescape¬ß` payload and the payload you want to execute as the `¬ßtest¬ß`. To perform this test, use Burp Suite‚Äôs cluster bomb attack, which will cycle through multiple payload lists and attempt every other payload against it

## Fuzzing for Directory Traversal

Another weakness you can fuzz for is directory traversal. Also known as path traversal, directory traversal is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to direct the web application to move to a parent directory using some form of the expression ../ and then read arbitrary files.

If you‚Äôre able to exit the API path, you may be able to access sensitive information such as application logic, usernames, passwords, and additional personally identifiable information (like names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses).

Directory traversal can be conducted using both wide and deep fuzzing techniques. Ideally, you would fuzz deeply across all of an API‚Äôs requests, but since this can be an enormous task, try fuzzing wide and then focus- ing in on specific request values. Make sure to enrich your payloads with information collected from reconnaissance, endpoint analysis, and API responses containing errors or other information disclosures.
