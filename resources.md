Not only do bug bounty programs reward hackers for finding and report- ing weaknesses that criminals would have otherwise compromised, but their write-ups are also an excellent source of API hacking lessons. If you pay attention to them, you might learn new techniques to use in your own testing. You can find write-ups on bug bounty platforms such as HackerOne and Bug Crowd or from independent sources like Pentester Land, ProgrammableWeb, and APIsecurity.io
